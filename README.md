## Description

AMG Basketball group was created to add and store player names salaries, years on team position and role! We made this application with the mindset of a Denver Nuggets GM. With this application you can add players to your roster and keep track of their positons, rolls, and salaries etc... We focused on a simple but intuitive UI that allows you to store youre players in local storage. As we move to the back end part of our bootcamp we want to implement more features to this application using databases to store players, add a log in page with password requirments as well as a calaneder API to track trade deadlines log trades and track season length. With hopes of adding more teams! We faced some challenges in our java scritp logic, but using our debugging procces we solidified our JS, HTML, and CSS skills.

## Usage
The instructions are very straight forward, use the input field on the left hand side to input your players information. click add player, and confirm player once the Modal appears. Dont worry if your roster gets to big and you still want to add players, the input field will scroll down the page with you making it easy to continue to input players as your roster grows!
